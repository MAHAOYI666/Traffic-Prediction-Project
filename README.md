# High-Speed Rail Network Traffic Prediction

This project implements and evaluates several deep learning models for predicting network traffic in high-speed rail scenarios. The primary model is a CNN-Transformer hybrid, with comparisons against baseline models such as RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, and a standard Transformer.
