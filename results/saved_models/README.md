# Saved Models Directory

This directory is designated for storing trained model weights and checkpoints (e.g., `.pth` or `.pt` files).

By default, this directory should be added to the project's `.gitignore` file to avoid committing large model files to the Git repository.

A `.gitkeep` file is included to ensure this directory is tracked by Git even when it is empty.
